simeng mu,5,"Joe Fortes is my favorite seafood restaurant in Vancouver. I love the atmosphereâ€”itâ€™s comfortable and elegant. The service is always friendly and attentive, which makes the experience even better. The food is super fresh, and Iâ€™m really impressed with how well everything is cooked. My top picks are the oysters, crab burger, and the fish and chips. Everything is so flavorful, and you can really taste the freshness of the seafood. Itâ€™s definitely a place Iâ€™d keep going back to.",2 weeks ago
JJ,5,"Iconic seafood restaurant in the heart of Vancouver. Finally had a chance to try it out a few months ago. There are inexpensive indoor pay parking nearby so no need to try wasting time finding street parking.

As soon as we entered, I can see the wall decors, the center bar and the table setting, all makes this establishment uniquely different from other restaurants.

They had many different options for oysters and the food menu is extensive. The food were very good & fresh. Our server was a joker, but unfortunately we didn't get most of his jokes lol

It was a lovely evening with friends and will be back here again for sure!",in the last week
Wilasinee Thongchalerm (Sidney),5,"We loved every dish we ordered! The oysters did not disappoint. We had seen photos in the reviews of the lobster and shrimp rolls and thought the portions would be small, but they werenâ€™t. The atmosphere was great, and the staff and service were excellent. I ordered the seafood bowl, and it was absolutely delicious!",3 weeks ago
Vivianne Nguyen,4,"I came here for the fresh seafood, and I think Joe mostly delivered it. Everything on the seafood tower was nice and fresh, especially the lobster. I wasnâ€™t too impressed with the taste of the clams; it has a weird taste to it..
We had gnocchi with bacon and truffle Parmesan fries for hot food. That bacon ðŸ¥“ is something else for sure. We probably got an old piece that tasted nothing like the other piece, but as soon as we notified the server, they were quick to swap it out with a fresh, hot piece. We really appreciate that.
The lobster oil that comes with the bread is very unique and yummy! I wish Iâ€™d remembered to purchase a bottle home ($37).
Our server was very attentive and gave good recommendations. She noticed that I ordered too much food and told me that if I decided I wanted more food after the seafood tower (yes it was a lot of food for one person LOL), just let her know and sheâ€™ll have the other dish come out very quickly. She cares more about your experience and wants you to be able to enjoy what you order than the amount of the bill and her total tips. Only experienced servers make that type of suggestions which we also appreciate!
Atmosphere wise, it can get very busy and noisy during prime time dinner. We made reservations and were able to secure a nice booth, but it is still a very busy and crowded room around us. Not a good choice if you want an intimate and quiet dinner.",3 months ago
Dr Jamie Smith,5,Top marks all round for this fabulous place. Stylish design with a great atmosphere combines with a superb menu backed up by outstanding service. I can't over state how attentive and impressive the service was. The crab cake was excellent as were the wider dishes and I will return. Find yourself in Vancouver then make a visit a priority.,a month ago
